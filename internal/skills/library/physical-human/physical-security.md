# Physical security (defense-in-depth)

Physical access defeats most cyber controls — a person at the keyboard, the
console port, or the disk wins. Design in concentric layers so bypassing one
control still leaves the attacker outside the next: **deter → detect → delay →
respond → recover**. No single fence, lock, or guard is the control; the
overlap is. This is the defensive counterpart to physical/social-eng offense
(`load_skill social-engineering-defense` for the human layer).

## Concentric zones (outer → inner)

- **Perimeter** — lighting, fencing, bollards/barriers, signage. CPTED's three
  levers: natural surveillance (sightlines, no blind corners), natural access
  control (one obvious funneled entry), territorial reinforcement (clear public
  vs private boundary). Goal: deter and channel, not just wall off.
- **Building shell** — badge-controlled entry, reception as a real checkpoint,
  no propped doors (door-held-open alarms), CCTV with retention ≥ 90 days.
- **Interior zones** — escalating credentials per sensitivity. Floors/wings
  segmented; a building badge ≠ a data-hall badge.
- **Secure room / cage / rack** — MFA at the door (badge + PIN or badge +
  biometric), and the rack itself locked. Smallest blast radius gets strongest control.

## Data-center / high-value facility controls

- **Mantrap / interlocking vestibule** at the data hall: two doors, only one
  opens at a time, one person per cycle — the structural anti-tailgating control.
- **Anti-passback**: a badge that entered can't enter again without an exit
  swipe — kills badge-sharing and pass-back. Enforce in + out sequencing.
- **MFA on sensitive zones**: badge + PIN / biometric / mobile credential.
- **CCTV + alarm fusion**: cameras on every door, alarms on forced/held doors,
  recorded and tied to badge events for after-the-fact reconstruction.
- **Asset control**: media/equipment in-out logging; no personal devices in the
  hall; sanitize or shred decommissioned drives (NIST SP 800-88).

## Tailgating / piggybacking defense

- The hardest human-layer problem: people hold doors out of politeness.
- Structural fixes beat policy: mantraps, full-height turnstiles, optical
  speed-lanes — one credential, one person.
- Detective: door-ajar alarms, anti-passback violations, video analytics for
  two-bodies-one-swipe, periodic badge-vs-presence audits.
- Cultural: "badge every person, every time," challenge-and-escort norm, no
  shame for asking a stranger to badge in. Reinforce via `load_skill security-awareness`.

## Visitor & badge management

- Pre-registration tied to a named internal sponsor + a time window.
- Photo ID check at sign-in; time-limited, visually distinct visitor badge;
  escort required in non-public zones; sign-out enforced.
- Employee badges: provisioned via joiners/movers/leavers workflow synced to HR
  — **same-day revoke on termination** is the control that actually matters.
  Periodic access recertification; deprovision orphaned/loaner badges.
- Contractors/vendors get scoped, expiring access — never permanent.

## Environmental & availability controls

- **Power**: dual feeds, UPS for ride-through, generator + fuel contract; test
  failover on a schedule (an untested generator is decoration).
- **HVAC/cooling**: redundant units, temp/humidity monitoring with alerting —
  thermal shutdown is an outage.
- **Fire**: VESDA early smoke detection + clean-agent (inert gas) suppression in
  data halls; never water over live equipment. Annual inspection.
- **Water/flood**: leak detection under raised floor; no equipment below grade
  in flood zones.

## Where physical meets cyber (the crossover risks)

- **Console / OOB access**: a serial/iLO/iDRAC/IPMI port is unauthenticated
  god-mode. Lock the rack, disable unused ports, credential the BMC, segment its mgmt network.
- **USB / removable media**: drop-key and BadUSB attacks bypass the perimeter.
  Disable/whitelist USB, epoxy or port-block where feasible, enforce DLP.
- **Evil-maid**: unattended/unencrypted device = full compromise via boot. Full-disk
  encryption with TPM + pre-boot PIN, Secure Boot, tamper-evident seals on travel laptops.
- **Shoulder-surf / clean-desk**: privacy screens, auto-lock, locked drawers,
  shred bins. Whiteboards and sticky notes are recon gold for an on-site attacker.
- **Network jacks / rogue devices**: 802.1X / MAC-auth on physical ports; disable
  unused jacks in lobbies/conference rooms; rogue-AP and unknown-device detection.

## Measure it

- Tailgating-test pass rate (red-team physical entry attempts caught).
- Mean time to revoke badge on termination (target: same business day).
- % doors with working alarm + camera coverage; % access reviews completed on time.
- Failover test cadence met (power/cooling/fire) — pass/fail, not "documented."
