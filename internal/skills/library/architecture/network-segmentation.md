# Network Segmentation

Segmentation exists for one reason: **contain the blast radius**. A flat network means one compromised host can reach everything; the attacker's lateral movement is free. Segmentation makes every hop cost the attacker another control to defeat. Judge any segmentation design by one question: _when host X is owned, what can it now reach?_

This is the network-centric leg of zero trust — pairs with `load_skill zero-trust` (identity decides who; segmentation shrinks what they can touch).

## Segmentation vs microsegmentation

A spectrum of granularity, not two products. Pick the coarsest level that bounds the blast radius you care about.

- **Macro-segmentation** — coarse zones (VLANs/subnets, prod vs dev, DMZ, PCI cardholder data environment). Controls **north-south** (zone-to-zone) traffic at a firewall. Cheap, well understood; useless against lateral movement _inside_ a zone.
- **Microsegmentation** — per-workload / per-application policy, ideally identity- or label-based, enforced at the host or workload edge (host firewall, hypervisor, service-mesh sidecar, cloud security group). Controls **east-west** (workload-to-workload). This is where lateral movement actually dies.
- Reach for microsegmentation around **crown jewels and high-blast-radius tiers** (domain controllers, databases, OT, PCI CDE) — not uniformly everywhere (operationally unaffordable). Macro-segment the estate; micro-segment the prizes.

## East-west is the point

Perimeter (north-south) firewalls catch the inbound attacker but see nothing once they're inside. Most damage is **east-west**: lateral movement from a phished workstation to a server to the domain controller. The pentest mirror of this is `load_skill network-enumeration` — if internal enum walks freely host-to-host, your segmentation is decorative.

- Default-deny east-west between tiers; allow only the specific flows the app needs.
- Block workstation-to-workstation entirely where possible (no business reason for peer SMB/RDP) — kills the most common lateral path.
- Segment management planes (RDP/SSH/WinRM/iLO) onto a separate admin network reached only via a jump host / PAW.

## Enforcement points — choose by trust and granularity

The enforcement point _is_ the architecture decision. Closer to the workload = smaller implicit-trust zone behind it, but more policy to manage.

| Enforcement point                    | Granularity            | Use for                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Perimeter / NGFW                     | Zone (north-south)     | Internet edge, zone boundaries, DMZ                   |
| Internal L3 firewall / router ACL    | Subnet/VLAN            | Macro-zones between business tiers                    |
| Cloud **Security Group** (stateful)  | Instance/ENI           | Default east-west control in cloud — per-workload     |
| Cloud **NACL** (stateless, subnet)   | Subnet                 | Coarse subnet guardrail; backstop, not primary        |
| **Host firewall** / agent (microseg) | Per-host / per-proc    | East-west kill-switch independent of network topology |
| **Service mesh** (mTLS + L7 policy)  | Per-service / identity | Container/K8s workloads; identity-based allow         |
| **Identity / ZTNA / SDP**            | Per-session/user       | Replace network reachability with brokered access     |

- In cloud, **Security Groups are your real microsegmentation** (per-instance, stateful, identity-referenceable); NACLs are a coarse stateless backstop. See `load_skill cloud-security`.
- Host-based enforcement survives a topology you don't control (cloud, BYOD, M&A) — preferred for true microsegmentation.
- The most resilient layer is identity (ZTNA): if the resource has _no_ network route and is reachable only through an authenticated broker, segmentation failures matter less.

## Trust zones — design rules

- Define zones by **data sensitivity + blast-radius tolerance**, not org chart.
- Every zone boundary gets default-deny + an explicit, documented allow-list. An undocumented allow rule is a finding.
- **No transitive trust**: zone A→B and B→C must not silently yield A→C.
- Put a **DMZ** between untrusted and internal; nothing internet-facing terminates directly on the internal network.
- Management/OT/IoT each get their own zone — they speak weak or unauthenticated protocols and must never share a broadcast domain with users.

## Purdue model (OT / ICS segmentation)

The reference model for segmenting industrial/OT networks — fetch ISA-95 / IEC 62443 for current detail. Levels, top to bottom:

- **Level 4/5** — Enterprise IT / business (ERP, internet).
- **Level 3.5 — the DMZ** (the load-bearing boundary): the only place IT and OT exchange data. No direct IT→OT path crosses it; brokers/historians/jump hosts mediate every flow.
- **Level 3** — Site operations (manufacturing ops systems).
- **Level 2** — Area supervisory (HMIs, SCADA).
- **Level 1** — Controllers (PLCs, RTUs).
- **Level 0** — Physical process (sensors, actuators).

Rules: **OT is unpatched, fragile, and safety-critical** — segmentation, not patching, is the primary control. No direct internet to any OT level. Treat the L3.5 DMZ as the crown-jewel boundary. IEC 62443 zones-and-conduits is the modern framing layered on Purdue.

## How segmentation caps blast radius (the payoff)

- Compromise of one segment ≠ compromise of the estate — the attacker must defeat a fresh control at each boundary, and each attempt generates detectable east-west traffic.
- Smaller segments = **smaller incident scope** = cheaper containment, narrower forensics, fewer notification obligations.
- It directly shrinks **compliance scope**: a well-segmented PCI CDE pulls everything outside it out of audit scope.
- Map segmentation gaps to controls with `load_skill control-mapping` (CWE-668; ISO A.8.20/A.8.22; NIST SC-7; CIS 12/13) and feed residual exposure into `load_skill risk-assessment`.

## Rules

- Segmentation without east-west enforcement is theater — perimeter-only does not contain a breach.
- Microsegment the crown jewels, macro-segment the rest; uniform microsegmentation collapses operationally.
- Every allow rule must trace to a documented app flow; undocumented allows are findings.
- In OT, segment don't patch; the L3.5 DMZ is non-negotiable.
