# AppSec & Secure SDLC

Application security is a property of the **pipeline**, not a scan at the end. Bugs get exponentially cheaper to fix the earlier you catch them, so the architecture goal is to **push each check to the leftmost point it can run** and gate there. The other half is the supply chain: most of your code is someone else's, so you must know _what_ you ship and _how_ it was built.

## Secure SDLC gates (shift-left, gate where it's cheapest)

One enforcing gate per phase. A gate that only warns is not a gate.

- **Design** — threat model the feature (`load_skill threat-modeling`). Output: security requirements + abuse cases. Cheapest fixes live here.
- **Code** — IDE/pre-commit linting, secret scanning, SAST on the diff. Fast feedback or developers route around it.
- **Build/CI** — SAST (full), SCA on dependencies, IaC scanning, **secret scanning**, generate SBOM + provenance. The primary enforcing gate.
- **Test/Staging** — DAST / IAST against a running build, integration-level auth tests.
- **Release** — sign artifacts, verify provenance, policy-as-code gate (block on critical + known-exploited).
- **Runtime/Prod** — WAF/RASP, ASPM correlation, feedback to the next threat model.

Rules: **gate on exploitable/known-exploited, not raw severity count** — a wall of low-confidence highs trains developers to ignore the gate. Make checks fast and low-false-positive at the left; tolerate slower, deeper checks further right. Break the build only on what you'll actually act on.

## SAST vs DAST vs IAST vs SCA — what each finds and misses

The four are complementary; none is sufficient alone. Match the tool to the bug class and the pipeline stage.

| Tool     | Sees                            | Stage          | Finds well                                                  | Misses / weakness                                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SAST** | Source / bytecode (white-box)   | Code / CI      | Injection, XSS, insecure crypto, taint flows in _your_ code | Runtime/config/auth-logic bugs; **noisy, high false-positive**       |
| **SCA**  | Dependency manifests + graph    | Code / CI      | Known-CVE vuln deps, license risk, transitive pulls         | Zero-days; custom code; whether the vuln path is reachable           |
| **DAST** | Running app (black-box)         | Test / staging | Real exploitable runtime, auth, config, injection           | No code location; poor coverage of unreached paths; slow             |
| **IAST** | Running app + instrumented code | Test (in QA)   | Runtime bugs _with_ code location, low FP                   | Needs instrumentation + exercising the code (test coverage gates it) |

- **SAST** = breadth + early, pays in false positives. Tune ruthlessly or it gets ignored.
- **SCA** = mandatory; your dependencies are most of your attack surface. Prefer SCA that does **reachability** analysis (is the vulnerable function actually called?) to cut noise.
- **DAST** = truth (it actually exploits) but late and location-blind. The web-app pentest mirror — see `load_skill sqli`, `load_skill xss`, `load_skill ssrf`.
- **IAST** = SAST accuracy + DAST realism, but only covers what your tests exercise.
- **ASPM** (Application Security Posture Management) sits _above_ these: it ingests SAST/DAST/SCA/IaC findings, dedupes, correlates with runtime/reachability, and surfaces only exploitable risk. It manages scanners, it is not a scanner. Reach for it when uncorrelated scanner noise is the bottleneck. (Cloud-infra analog: `load_skill cloud-security`.)

## OWASP SAMM & ASVS — maturity vs verification

Two OWASP standards, two different jobs. Use them together.

- **SAMM** (Software Assurance Maturity Model, **v2** current as of 2026 — `https://owaspsamm.org`) — measures **process maturity** of your AppSec _program_ across 5 business functions (Governance, Design, Implementation, Verification, Operations) / 15 practices, scored at maturity levels 1–3. Use it to assess and build the program roadmap (same Current→Target gap method as `load_skill gap-analysis`).
- **ASVS** (Application Security Verification Standard, **v5.0** current, May 2025 — `https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/`) — a **verification checklist** of concrete security requirements across levels L1/L2/L3 (rising assurance). Use it as the requirement set you test _against_ — turns "is it secure" into a checkable list.
- Pairing: **SAMM tells you how good your process is; ASVS tells you whether a given app meets requirements.** SAMM for the program, ASVS per-application. Verify both versions are still current before citing.

## Software supply chain (you ship other people's code)

Two questions: **what's in it** (SBOM) and **how was it built / can I trust it** (provenance, SLSA, signing).

- **SBOM** (Software Bill of Materials) — machine-readable inventory of every component + version + license (formats: **SPDX**, **CycloneDX**). Generate it in CI per build; it's what lets you answer "are we affected by CVE-X" in minutes, not weeks (the Log4Shell lesson). An SBOM you don't ingest/query is shelfware.
- **SLSA** (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts, OpenSSF — `https://slsa.dev`; **v1.2** current, 2025) — a graded framework for **build integrity + provenance**. Now split into a **Build track** (below) and a **Source track** (v1.2 promoted it from experimental to approved — grades version-control history integrity + enforced code review). Build track:
  - **L1** — produce provenance (releases traceable to how they were built).
  - **L2** — signed provenance on a hosted/protected build platform.
  - **L3** — hardened, isolated builds with non-falsifiable provenance and protected signing secrets.
  - Targets the "tampered build / poisoned pipeline" threat (SolarWinds class). Verify the spec level definitions are current.
- **Signing + verification** — sign artifacts and _verify on the consuming side_ (Sigstore/cosign for keyless signing; in-toto attestations). Signing you don't verify at deploy buys nothing — **enforce verification at the release gate.**
- **Dependency hygiene** — pin/lock versions, verify checksums, prefer an internal proxy/registry, watch for typosquats and dependency-confusion (internal-name packages must resolve internally first).

## Where to enforce

- The build/CI stage is the single highest-leverage enforcing gate — SAST, SCA, secret scan, SBOM, provenance all converge there.
- Verify signatures + provenance at the **release** gate, not at build (build can be tampered).
- Map AppSec findings to controls with `load_skill control-mapping` (CWE → ISO/NIST/CIS); feed unfixed risk to `load_skill risk-assessment`.
- Design-phase requirements come from `load_skill threat-modeling` — close the loop by turning threats into ASVS-style tested requirements.

## Rules

- Gate on exploitable/known-exploited, not severity counts — noise kills the gate's credibility.
- No single scanner is sufficient: SAST+SCA in CI, DAST/IAST in test, ASPM to correlate.
- An SBOM you can't query and a signature you don't verify are both theater.
- Tune SAST false positives aggressively; an ignored gate is worse than no gate.
