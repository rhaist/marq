# Data security architecture

Protect the data, not just the perimeter around it — because the perimeter is
gone (SaaS, BYOD, third-party processors). Everything here depends on one thing
you must do first: **know what data you have and where it flows** (data discovery

- a data map / RoPA). You cannot classify or protect what you can't see.

## Classification scheme that people actually use

The failure mode is a 6-tier taxonomy nobody applies. Use **4 tiers, max**, named
for handling consequences not abstractions:

| Tier             | Examples                                              | Handling rule                                                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public**       | Marketing, published docs                             | No controls; just integrity (don't let it be tampered).                     |
| **Internal**     | Org charts, internal wikis                            | Default for everything; SSO-gated, not shared externally.                   |
| **Confidential** | Customer PII, source code, contracts                  | Encrypt, access on need-to-know, DLP-monitored, logged.                     |
| **Restricted**   | Secrets, regulated data (PHI, cardholder, auth creds) | Strongest: tokenize/encrypt, JIT access, key-separated, narrow legal basis. |

Rules that make it stick:

- **Sensible default** (Internal) so unlabeled data isn't unprotected.
- Classify by the **most sensitive element** in a dataset; one SSN makes the table Restricted.
- Map tier -> _handling matrix_ (storage, transit, sharing, retention) — the tier
  is useless without the "so therefore you must" actions next to it.
- Auto-classify where possible (DLP/cloud-native classifiers, MS Pur), but the data
  _owner_ accepts the label. Labels drive DLP policy and encryption automatically.
- Regulated categories ride on top: cross-link `load_skill privacy-eu` — GDPR
  "special category" data and PCI cardholder data force the Restricted handling
  regardless of your internal label.

## DLP — and its hard limits

DLP enforces the handling matrix by inspecting data in three places:

- **Network DLP** — egress inspection (email, web uploads). Blind to TLS it can't
  break; useless against personal devices/networks.
- **Endpoint DLP** — agent watches copy/USB/print/upload on managed devices. Blind
  on unmanaged/BYOD.
- **Cloud DLP / CASB / DSPM** — scans SaaS + cloud stores (S3, OneDrive, Snowflake),
  the place most data now actually lives. This is where to invest in 2026.

**Limits — set expectations honestly:**

- DLP catches **accidental/sloppy** leaks well; a motivated insider defeats it
  (photograph the screen, retype, steganography, personal device).
- It is **content-pattern-bound** — strong on regex-able data (card/SSN), weak on
  unstructured IP ("the secret recipe").
- High false-positive tax; start in **monitor/log mode**, tune, then enforce on the
  highest tiers only. A DLP rolled out in block mode on day one gets disabled by week two.
- It does **not** replace access control or encryption — it's the detective layer
  over them. Treat DLP findings as signal into `load_skill incident-response-leadership`.

## Encryption: at rest, in transit, in use

| State          | Protects against                            | Standard                                         | Catch                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **At rest**    | Stolen disk/backup/DB file                  | AES-256 (XTS for disk, GCM for records)          | Transparent disk/DB encryption protects a _powered-off_ disk only — a live app/DB sees plaintext. Doesn't stop a compromised app. |
| **In transit** | Network sniffing / MITM                     | **TLS 1.3** (1.2 floor; kill TLS 1.0/1.1, SSLv3) | Internal/east-west traffic too, not just edge. mTLS for service-to-service.                                                       |
| **In use**     | Cloud host/hypervisor/insider w/ RAM access | **Confidential computing** (TEEs)                | Newer, perf overhead, attestation complexity.                                                                                     |

**Encryption in use / confidential computing** (verify, fast-moving):

- VM-level TEEs are the current shape — **AMD SEV-SNP** and **Intel TDX** encrypt
  guest RAM against the hypervisor/host; older Intel SGX was process-enclave only.
- TDX uses AES-256, SEV-SNP AES-128 for memory encryption; both add **remote
  attestation** so you prove the workload ran in a genuine TEE before releasing secrets.
- Use it for: regulated/multi-tenant cloud workloads, sensitive AI/ML on shared infra,
  "we don't trust the cloud operator" threat models. Verify current support per cloud:
  https://docs.cloud.google.com/confidential-computing/confidential-vm/docs/confidential-vm-overview
- Post-quantum: at-rest data with long secrecy lifetimes is the "harvest-now-decrypt-
  later" target — start planning PQC migration; cross-link `load_skill crypto-key-management`.

## Tokenization vs encryption — pick deliberately

- **Encryption** — reversible with a key; ciphertext is mathematically derived from
  the plaintext. Right for data you must process/decrypt at scale.
- **Tokenization** — replace the value with a random token; real value lives in a
  separate **token vault**. There is no key in the data path to steal — the token is
  meaningless without vault access.
- Use **tokenization** to pull systems out of compliance scope: tokenized PAN means
  the app/DB never holds cardholder data, so it falls out of PCI-DSS scope. Same play
  for SSNs in analytics. Format-preserving tokens keep schemas intact.
- Use **encryption** when you need the real value back in many places (DB-level,
  field-level encryption). Tokenization scales worse (vault is a bottleneck/SPOF) but
  shrinks scope better.

## Key separation (the rule that makes encryption real)

Encryption at rest is theater if the key sits next to the data. Enforce:

- **Keys in a KMS/HSM**, separated from the ciphertext, with their own access policy.
- The DB admin who can read the encrypted store must **not** also hold the decryption
  key (separation of duties). Envelope encryption: data key wraps data, KEK wraps data key.
- Rotation, escrow, dual-control, key-deletion-as-crypto-shredding — all live in the
  sibling skill: `load_skill crypto-key-management`. This skill defines _when_ to
  encrypt; that one defines _how to run the keys_.

## Data lifecycle & retention

- **Minimize at intake** — the cheapest data to protect is the data you never collected
  (GDPR data-minimization; cross-link `load_skill privacy-eu`).
- **Retention schedule per classification** — define max retention; default-delete, don't
  default-keep. "Keep everything forever" is unmanaged liability + bigger breach blast radius.
- **Defensible deletion** — automated expiry, documented, including backups and
  derived/replicated copies (the data lake and the SaaS export, not just the primary).
- **Crypto-shredding** — for distributed/immutable stores, destroy the key to render
  data unrecoverable when physical deletion is impractical.
- Lifecycle stages to control: create/classify -> store -> use -> share -> archive ->
  destroy. Each tier gets stricter rules at every stage.
