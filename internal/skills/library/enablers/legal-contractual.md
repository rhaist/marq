# Legal & contractual surface

> **Not legal advice.** This is practitioner orientation so a security person can read a contract intelligently, flag the security-relevant clauses, and brief counsel. **Counsel/privacy/procurement own the language and the sign-off** — your job is to know what to look for and what it means operationally.

## The documents

- **MSA / main agreement** — liability, indemnity, term, governing law.
- **DPA (Data Processing Agreement)** — required when a processor handles personal data (GDPR Art. 28). Defines controller/processor roles, purpose, subprocessors, SCCs for cross-border transfer, deletion-on-exit, breach notice.
- **Security Addendum / Exhibit** — the actual security controls the vendor commits to (encryption, MFA, pen-test cadence, SDLC, certs). This is the technically enforceable part — read it, don't accept "industry standard."
- **SLA** — uptime + the _security_ SLAs (breach notice clock, vuln-remediation timelines).

## Clauses that matter (and what to push for)

- **Breach notification SLA** — the number, in hours, and the trigger. Push for **≤72h, ideally 24–48h**, from _discovery_ (not "confirmation"). Vague "without undue delay" = unbounded; pin it. Must be tight enough to let _you_ meet _your_ regulator clock (GDPR 72h — `load_skill privacy-eu`; NIS2 24h early-warning / DORA hours — `load_skill nis2-dora`). Define what's in the notice + a named contact path.
- **Audit rights** — right to audit / request evidence / receive SOC 2 + pen-test summaries on a cadence. Watch for "once per year, 90 days' notice, at your cost" defanging it. Right to audit _after a security incident_ regardless of schedule is the one that matters.
- **Right-to-pentest** — explicit permission to security-test the service (or to receive the vendor's recent test). SaaS often forbids testing without written consent — get it in writing or you can't validate. Define scope + safe harbor.
- **Liability caps & carve-outs** — caps often = 12 months' fees, which won't cover a real breach. Push **data-breach / confidentiality / IP-infringement** into a **super-cap or uncapped carve-out**. The cap is where the money is — read it with counsel. Watch exclusion of "consequential damages" swallowing breach costs.
- **Subprocessors / 4th parties** — list + **advance notice and a right to object** to new ones. Flow-down: subprocessors bound to equivalent terms. Concentration risk (everyone on one cloud) — see `load_skill third-party-risk`.
- **Data residency / localization** — where data is stored/processed; transfer mechanism (SCCs, adequacy). Matters for GDPR, sector rules, and gov work.
- **Deletion / return on exit** — data returned or destroyed within N days of termination, with **certification**. Otherwise your data lives on indefinitely.
- **Security-control commitments** — encryption at rest/in transit, MFA, least privilege, logging, named certs maintained for the term. Make them _obligations_, not aspirations.

## Cyber insurance

Risk-transfer for residual risk; underwriting now effectively mandates a security baseline. **Read the conditions as a control checklist** — the policy tells you what "good" looks like to an insurer.

- **Covers (first-party)**: incident response, forensics, breach notification costs, business interruption, data restoration, **sometimes** ransom (shrinking). **Third-party**: liability to affected parties, regulatory defense/fines where insurable.
- **Underwriting demands (2025–26, hardened)**: **MFA everywhere** (phishing-resistant for privileged/remote), **EDR on all endpoints** (basic AV insufficient — ~88% of underwriters require EDR), **immutable/offline backups** (~82% of policies, up from ~45% in 2022), PAM, network segmentation, 24/7 monitoring, tested IR plan, vendor due-diligence. verify: https://www.secureait.com/2025/12/09/cyber-insurance-requirements-are-getting-tougher-what-every-organization-must-know-in-2026/
- **Common exclusions / denial traps**: **war/nation-state** exclusion (Lloyd's clauses), **social engineering / funds-transfer fraud** needs a separate endorsement, ransom payment may be excluded, **failure-to-maintain-stated-controls voids the claim**. ~37% of claims see a coverage dispute over a security gap (the one un-patched laptop, the one account without MFA). verify: https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/cybersecurity/cyber-insurance-statistics/
- **Operational rule**: your application answers become **warranties** — if you attest MFA-everywhere and one box lacks it, the payout can be voided. Answer truthfully; close the gap before signing. Keep evidence (`load_skill grc-automation`) to prove controls were live at incident time.

## Regulatory vs. contractual breach obligations (don't conflate)

- **Regulatory** = duty to a **regulator/data subjects** by law on a statutory clock (GDPR 72h — `load_skill privacy-eu`; NIS2 24/72h/1mo + DORA hours — `load_skill nis2-dora`; US state AG laws + sector rules — `load_skill privacy-us`, `us-sectoral-regs`). Non-compliance → fines.
- **Contractual** = duty to a **counterparty** by the contract's notice SLA. Non-compliance → breach-of-contract liability, not a regulatory fine.
- **One incident fires both, on different clocks, to different audiences.** Your IR runbook needs a notification matrix: which regulators + which customers/partners, each with its trigger and deadline. The contractual clock is often _shorter_ than the regulatory one — meet the tightest.
- **Practitioner stance**: pre-map obligations _before_ an incident. Mid-incident is the wrong time to read 40 DPAs to find notice deadlines. Counsel decides _what/whether_ to notify; you supply the facts and the clock.
