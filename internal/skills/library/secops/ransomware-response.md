description: End-to-end ransomware incident playbook — scope encryption vs exfiltration, isolate without losing evidence, identify the strain and find a decryptor, watch the leak site, restore clean-room in known-good order, and make the payment decision with its legal duties (OFAC, Australia, NYDFS, CIRCIA, UK).

# Ransomware response

Defensive/IR playbook. A ransomware case is **two incidents at once**: **availability**
(encryption, outage) and usually **confidentiality** (exfiltration, double extortion), so run
two workstreams with separate evidence. Lifecycle: `load_skill incident-response`; commander's
calls: `load_skill incident-response-leadership`; business crisis: `load_skill crisis-management`.
The legal parts are practitioner orientation, not legal advice; counsel owns them.

## First hour (in this order)

1. **Declare Sev 1, go out-of-band.** Assume the actor reads email/chat and the IR channel.
2. **Stop the spread, keep the evidence.** Network-isolate (EDR/switchport/VLAN); don't power
   off, since RAM holds keys and live C2. Power down only a host you can't disconnect that is
   still encrypting. verify: https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/ransomware-guide
3. **Save the backups first.** Cut the backup console off from prod identity, rotate its admin
   creds out-of-band, check for retention/immutability changes and deleted jobs, and snapshot
   what survives. `load_skill backup-recovery`.
4. **Identity:** disable (don't delete) compromised accounts, kill sessions/tokens, block C2 and
   exfil paths (rclone/MEGA egress). Hold the krbtgt double reset until you can hold the line.
5. **Export short-retention telemetry now** (EDR is often 7–30 days; also firewall/VPN, cloud
   audit). Keep the ransom note, encrypted samples and a patient-zero memory image, hashed,
   with chain of custody. Don't reimage patient zero before capture.
6. **Call counsel first** (engage the IR firm through counsel for privilege), then the
   **insurer** (notice clause; panel vendors only, or cover can be lost), then law enforcement.
7. **Start the notification matrix:** awareness is today. `load_skill breach-notification-matrix`.

## Scope: encryption vs exfiltration (answer both, separately)

| Question             | Evidence to pull                                                                                          | Why it matters                                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What is encrypted?   | Host list, hypervisors (ESXi/vCenter takes whole estates), NAS, backups, cloud storage                    | Recovery size; whether restore beats MTPD (`load_skill business-continuity`) |
| Was data taken?      | rclone/WinSCP/restic artifacts, 7z/RAR staging, egress spikes in NetFlow, cloud API reads, leak-site post | Turns an outage into a breach: GDPR Art. 34, state laws, HIPAA               |
| How did they get in? | Edge device CVE (check KEV), VPN creds without MFA, phishing loader, RMM abuse, third-party access        | Close it before restore or you get re-encrypted                              |
| When?                | Earliest attacker activity, not detonation time                                                           | Sets the clean restore point (dwell is often weeks)                          |
| Still inside?        | New accounts, GPO changes, RMM tools (AnyDesk/ScreenConnect), scheduled tasks, cloud app consents         | Decides when eradication and reconnection are safe                           |

- **Missing logs are not evidence of no exfiltration.** Regulators ask what you could see.
- Encryption-only still counts: it is a GDPR breach (availability) and a presumed HIPAA breach
  unless a low-probability-of-compromise assessment shows otherwise. Data-theft-only extortion
  (no encryption) is common now; run the same playbook without the restore.

## Identify the strain and check for a decryptor

- Fingerprint: note filename/text, encrypted extension, Tor chat URL or TOX ID, leak-site
  brand. Triage the binary on a copy: hash, `yara_scan`, `capa`, `bin_headers`
  (`load_skill malware-triage`). Map TTPs to an actor (`load_skill actor-ttp-attribution`):
  that drives the sanctions check. **Brand ≠ actor**: affiliates move between RaaS programmes
  and sanctioned groups rebrand, so check the infrastructure and the wallet, not the name.
- **No More Ransom** (Europol-led): Crypto Sheriff identifies the strain from a note + sample
  and lists free decryptors. verify: https://www.nomoreransom.org/ . ID Ransomware does the
  same, but uploading is disclosure: send the note, not a sensitive file. Ask LE too:
  takedowns (e.g. LockBit, Operation Cronos 2024) have yielded keys before any public tool.
- **Test any decryptor (free or paid) on copies**, never in place; actor decryptors are slow
  and buggy on large VM disks. Keep the encrypted copies in case a decryptor appears later.

## Leak-site and extortion watch

- Track the group's leak site through TI feeds/trackers or an isolated research VM over Tor,
  never from a corporate browser. `load_skill ti-research`, `load_skill ioc-pivoting`.
- Record post time, countdown and every sample file: samples are your best evidence of
  **what** was taken. They can be recycled from an older breach, so verify them, but the
  regulatory clock keeps running. Never say "no data taken" publicly before you know.
- Expect pressure on others (calls to customers and staff, DDoS, harassment of executives).
  Brief the service desk and comms. Downloading the leaked set is a counsel decision; if
  approved, work in an isolated enclave. It is the best input for who must be notified.

## Clean-room restore (known-good order)

Never restore into the compromised environment. Build an isolated recovery environment
(new network segment, clean admin workstations, EDR on everything brought up), then:

1. **Identity plane:** AD forest recovery from a pre-compromise DC backup (or a rebuild);
   krbtgt reset twice with replication in between; all privileged/service accounts reset.
   Cloud IdP: review federation trusts, app registrations, conditional-access changes.
2. **Core services:** DNS/DHCP, PKI (re-issue if the CA was touched), the backup platform itself.
3. **Critical business apps** in BIA/RTO order, minimum viable first (`load_skill disaster-recovery`).
4. **Endpoints/servers:** reimage from golden images and restore **data**, not system state.

- Pick a recovery point **before initial access**, not before detonation. Mount and scan
  backups for the case's IOCs/persistence (`yara_scan`) before restoring.
- Reconnect only when the entry vector is closed and eradication exit criteria are met
  (hunt clean: `load_skill threat-hunting`). Getting hit again soon after is common.

## The payment decision

The board/exec decides with counsel and the insurer, not the IR lead. Any actor contact
goes through a specialist negotiator (often from the insurer's panel), never ad hoc staff.

- **Primary question:** can we restore within MTPD without paying? If yes, payment buys only a
  deletion promise you cannot enforce ("deleted" sets resurface). If it buys a decryptor, demand proof of
  decryption on sample files and keep recovery and eradication running in parallel.
- Payment marks you for re-targeting. Document alternatives considered and the legal
  analysis; regulators, the insurer and the board will read this record.

- **Insurer:** get written consent before engaging vendors and before paying. Check the
  extortion sublimit, the war exclusion and control warranties (`load_skill legal-contractual`).
  For UK decisions, see the NCSC guidance written with ABI/BIBA/IUA (2023).
- **Law enforcement** (FBI field office/IC3, CISA, NCA/NCSC, ASD ReportCyber) can bring keys
  from takedowns, wallet tracing, actor intel and the OFAC mitigation credit. LE won't run
  your recovery and won't normally ask you to stop restoring.
- Paying never removes a notification duty; the data was still accessed.

## Close-out

`report_finding` each confirmed TTP (ATT&CK id), the entry vector and every control gap
(unprotected backup path, edge device without MFA, missed restore RTO), then run `render_report`.
Feed the gaps into `load_skill risk-assessment` and `load_skill detection-engineering`.
