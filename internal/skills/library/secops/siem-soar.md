# SIEM & SOAR

The SIEM is only as good as what you feed it and how ruthlessly you tune it.
Order of work: get the high-value logs in → write behaviour-based detections
(not signature noise) → automate the repetitive triage → tune relentlessly.
Detection content is code: author it with `load_skill detection-engineering`.

## Log sources — collect in this order (value per byte)

1. **Identity / authN** — IdP + directory (Entra ID, Okta, AD security log: 4624/
   4625/4768/4769/4776), VPN. Most intrusions are credential-driven; this is the
   single highest-signal source.
2. **Endpoint EDR / process telemetry** — Sysmon (1 process, 3 net, 7 image-load,
   8 remote-thread, 11 file, 13 registry) or EDR. The detection-engineering
   workhorse; map fields to ATT&CK techniques.
3. **Cloud control plane** — AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity, GCP Audit, M365/
   Graph audit. Where modern attacks actually land. Enable management _and_ data
   events for crown-jewel buckets.
4. **DNS + proxy/web + firewall flows** — C2, exfil, beaconing. DNS query logs
   catch what TLS hides.
5. **Email security gateway** — phishing is still the front door.
6. **App / WAF / auth logs of crown-jewel apps**; then everything else.

Collect for _detections and investigations you'll actually run_, not "all logs."
Volume = cost + noise. Right-size retention by tier (hot 30–90d, cold 1yr+ for IR/
compliance). Normalize to a schema (OCSF/ASIM/ECS) so detections are portable.

## Detection content vs noise

- Buy/import a baseline (vendor analytics, SigmaHQ ~3000 rules) but treat each as a
  candidate — every imported rule is a noise liability until tuned for _your_ env.
- Prefer behaviour over atomic IOC matches (pyramid of pain — TTP detections
  survive; hash/IP rules churn). ATT&CK v18 ships Detection Strategies + Analytics
  (Data Sources retired Oct 2025) — use them to anchor coverage.

- Every detection needs: a documented hypothesis, ATT&CK id, expected FP sources,
  data-source dependency, and a triage runbook. No runbook = don't ship it.
- Track coverage as an ATT&CK heatmap; chase _gaps that match your threat model_,
  not raw technique count.

## SOAR playbook patterns

- Automate the alerts that look the same every time. Canonical wins:
  - **Phishing**: parse reported mail → detonate URL/attachment in sandbox →
    rep/TI lookups → auto-close benign / pull mail + escalate if malicious.
  - **Enrichment-on-ingest**: every alert gets user identity, asset criticality,
    geo/ASN, TI verdict, and recent-change context _before_ it hits the queue.
  - **Auto-close / auto-suppress** known benign positives (vuln scanner source IPs,
    sanctioned admin tools) with a logged reason.
  - **Containment with guardrails**: isolate host / disable user _only_ on high-
    confidence + approved scope; require human approval for blast-radius actions.
- Beware playbook decay: environments, vendor APIs, and attacker TTPs drift, so a
  playbook silently returns wrong answers. Version playbooks, test on a cadence,
  alert on action failures.

## Alert triage & tuning (fight fatigue)

- Categorize every closed alert: true / benign / false positive. That label _is_
  the tuning feedback loop — un-labeled closes teach you nothing.
- The lever order: **suppress** (known-benign) → **dedupe/aggregate** (one
  incident, not 500 alerts) → **enrich** (auto-downgrade in change windows) →
  **threshold/logic tune** → **retire** dead rules.
- Risk-rank the queue by asset criticality × user risk × confidence; analysts work
  top-down, not FIFO.
- Watch >50% FP rates and rising MTTR as the fatigue signal. Run a monthly
  detection audit: top-noise rules, never-fired rules, rules with no runbook.
- A confirmed true positive is an incident — hand off to `load_skill
incident-response`. A recurring detection gap becomes a hunt
  (`load_skill threat-hunting`).

## Current landscape (verify — consolidating fast)

- SIEM/SOAR/XDR are converging into single platforms. Leaders 2026: Microsoft
  Sentinel (+ Defender XDR, Security Copilot), Google SecOps (Chronicle + Gemini),
  Splunk (now Cisco), Palo Alto XSIAM, CrowdStrike Next-Gen SIEM, Elastic.
- QRadar SaaS (now Palo Alto) end-of-life **2026-04-14** — migration driver.
- Standalone SOAR is being absorbed; AI/agentic triage is the 2026 pitch (auto-
  enrich + correlate, escalate to human only on genuine need). Treat AI triage as
  a tuned auto-close, not a replacement for detection rigor.

## marq tie-in

This host is offensive tooling, not a SIEM. Use it to _generate the telemetry a
detection should catch_ (run `nmap`/`nuclei` and confirm the SIEM alerts), and
`report_finding` any logging blind spot you prove (e.g. an attack with no
corresponding log source) so it lands in the engagement report.
