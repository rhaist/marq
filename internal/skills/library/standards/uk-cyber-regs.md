# UK cyber & privacy regulation (practitioner orientation, NOT legal advice)

The UK left the EU before NIS2, DORA, the CRA and the AI Act, so **none of them apply in GB as law** — the UK runs its own, mostly narrower and more regulator-led, versions. A UK firm selling into the EU still meets the EU regimes (`load_skill nis2-dora`, `load_skill eu-cra`, `load_skill privacy-eu`). Dates below were checked Nov 2026; Parliament and commencement orders move them — re-verify.

## NIS Regulations 2018 and the Cyber Security and Resilience Bill

- **NIS Regs today:** OES + RDSPs, regulated sector-by-sector (Ofgem/DESNZ, DfT/CAA, DWI, Ofcom, DHSC/health bodies, ICO for RDSPs). Duty of appropriate and proportionate measures; incident notification ≤72h; max penalty **£17m**. The CAF (below) is the assessment instrument most CAs use. verify: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/506
- **Cyber Security and Resilience (Network and Information Systems) Bill** — amends the NIS Regs rather than replacing them. Status (verified 6 Nov 2026): Commons stages done (report/third reading ~16 Jun 2026), carried over into the 2026–27 session (HL Bill 32); **Lords 2R 14 Jul, committee 1–7 Sep, report 26 Oct, third reading 2 Nov 2026** — now back in the **Commons for consideration of Lords amendments** (ping-pong). **Not law yet**, and even after Royal Assent most duties start only when **commencement regulations + secondary legislation/codes** land. verify: https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/4035
- What it adds: **relevant managed service providers (RMSPs)** in scope; **data centres** as essential services (thresholds by rated IT load — sources cite ~1MW for third-party/colocation and ~10MW for enterprise sites, verify); power to designate **critical suppliers**; incident reporting widened to incidents _capable_ of significant impact, **initial notice ≤24h, full report ≤72h**, to the regulator **and NCSC**; data centres/RDSPs/RMSPs must **notify likely-affected customers**; Secretary-of-State direction powers for national security; regulator cost recovery. Penalties two-tier: **£10m / 2%** and **£17m / 4%** of worldwide turnover (verify final text).
- Lords amendments now in ping-pong: a **statutory review of the NIS scheme within 12 months** and a **register of hostile state actors**; a frontier-AI incident-reporting amendment was defeated. Watch whether the Commons accepts them.
- Practitioner move now: if you're an MSP or data-centre operator, build the 24h/72h reporting path and customer-notification template ahead of commencement — it's the same muscle as NIS2 Art. 23.

## UK GDPR after the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025

- **DUAA** — Royal Assent **19 Jun 2025**, commenced in stages. The bulk of the Part 5 data-protection changes came into force **5 Feb 2026** (SI 2026/82): **recognised legitimate interests** (Annex 1 list, no balancing test — e.g. crime prevention, safeguarding, security of systems), relaxed **automated decision-making** (Art. 22A–D: permitted with safeguards unless special-category data), a new **"not materially lower"** data-protection test for international transfers, and research/cookie changes (some analytics cookies consent-exempt; PECR fines raised toward UK GDPR levels — verify which date each commenced). **Complaints procedure duty from 19 Jun 2026** (s.103: you must run a data-protection complaints process). verify: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-use-and-access-act-2025-plans-for-commencement
- **ICO became the Information Commission on 30 Sep 2026** — a board-led body; it still trades as "ICO" and the chair keeps the "Information Commissioner" title. Update policies/DPAs that name the regulator only if you care about legal precision. verify: https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/what-we-do/legislation-we-cover/data-use-and-access-act-2025/
- **Unchanged for a security team:** breach to the ICO **≤72h** of awareness (Art. 33), individuals without undue delay if high risk (Art. 34); fines up to **£17.5m or 4%**; Art. 32 security of processing; DPIAs.
- **EU adequacy renewed 19 Dec 2025, valid to 27 Dec 2031** — EEA→UK flows need no SCCs. The EU will keep watching DUAA divergence; a material weakening (e.g. via the transfer test or ADM) is the adequacy risk to diary. verify: https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/receiving-personal-information-from-the-eea/
- UK→US: the **UK Extension to the EU–US DPF** ("data bridge") — same CJEU-appeal risk as the EU DPF (`load_skill privacy-eu`); keep the IDTA/Addendum as fallback.

## NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF)

- **Current: CAF v4.0 (4 Aug 2025)**; no v4.1 as of Nov 2026. 4 objectives (A Managing risk, B Protecting, C Detecting, D Minimising impact), 14 principles, contributing outcomes judged Achieved / Partially / Not achieved against **IGPs** (indicators of good practice). New in v4.0: **A2.b Understanding threat**, **A4.b Secure software development and support** (provenance, attestable integrity), reworked **C1 monitoring/threat hunting** (triage, playbooks, automated response), AI risk throughout. verify: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cyber-assessment-framework
- **Profiles** are set by regulators, not NCSC: the **CAF Core Profile** (built on v4.0, aimed at moderately capable adversaries — ransomware, supply chain) is the transition baseline. Ask your CA which profile and version it expects in the next self-assessment.
- NCSC is building a CAF-based **Cyber Resilience Audit scheme** for assured independent assessment alongside the Bill (verify status). Pitfall: CAF is outcome-based — screenshots of a policy don't evidence "Achieved"; show the outcome operating.

## Cyber Essentials (CE / CE Plus)

- **Requirements for IT Infrastructure v3.3 (question set "Danzell"), effective 27 Apr 2026.** Five controls: firewalls, secure configuration, security update management (critical/high patches ≤14 days), user access control, malware protection. CE = verified self-assessment; **CE Plus** = same requirements + hands-on technical audit. verify: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/resources
- v3.3 changes that fail people: **MFA on every cloud service that supports it is an automatic fail if missing** (free or paid tier, users and admins); cloud services **cannot be scoped out** (social media accounts count); FIDO2/passkeys count as MFA; backup is recommended, not required. Accounts opened before the switch had 6 months on the old version.
- It's a **floor**, not a framework — useful for supply-chain gating (`load_skill third-party-risk`), not evidence of NIS/CAF maturity.

## PSTI — consumer connectable product security

- In force **29 Apr 2024**: **no universal/default passwords**, a published **vulnerability disclosure policy** (contact + acknowledgement/status updates), and a stated **minimum security-update period** at point of sale; manufacturers ship a **statement of compliance**. Duties also bite importers/distributors. Exclusions include laptops/desktops, smart meters, medical devices, vehicles (separate regimes).
- Enforcer **OPSS**: compliance/stop/recall notices, penalties up to **£10m or 4%** of worldwide revenue + **£20k/day**. 2025–26 was education-first (100+ product assessments, 200+ VDPs checked); no amendment regs found. verify: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-product-security-and-telecommunications-infrastructure-product-security-regime
- Versus the EU CRA: PSTI is **three requirements on consumer products**; the CRA is a full essential-requirements + conformity-assessment + 24h vuln-reporting regime for nearly all products with digital elements. Selling in both = build to the CRA.

## Finance (the UK's answer to DORA)

- **PRA/FCA operational resilience** (SS1/21, PS21/3): important business services, impact tolerances, mapping + scenario testing — fully in force since 31 Mar 2025. **Critical third parties** regime (FSMA 2023; rules from 1 Jan 2025) — HM Treasury designates; no designation list confirmed in my check (verify).
- **FCA PS26/2 + PRA PS7/26 (18 Mar 2026), applying 18 Mar 2027:** a single operational-incident reporting regime (PRA collapsed initial/interim/final into one report) plus notification of **material third-party arrangements** and an annual register. verify: https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps26-2-operational-incident-third-party-reporting
- Intelligence-led testing is **CBEST**, not TIBER-EU/TLPT — `load_skill red-teaming`.

## Where the UK diverges from the EU (the comparison clients ask for)

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope of cyber law   | NIS2: 18 sectors, essential + important, size-cap | NIS Regs: 5 sectors + RDSPs; Bill adds MSPs, data centres, critical suppliers — **no manufacturing/food/postal/chemicals tier** |
| Incident clock       | 24h early warning / 72h / 1 month                 | Today ≤72h; Bill: 24h initial / 72h full                                                                                        |
| Management liability | Explicit NIS2 board accountability + training     | No NIS2-style board-liability clause in the Bill as I read it (verify); governance via CAF A1                                   |
| Privacy              | GDPR; Digital Omnibus pending                     | UK GDPR + DUAA: recognised LIs, looser ADM, own transfer test, complaints duty                                                  |
| Products             | CRA (full lifecycle, CE marking)                  | PSTI (3 requirements, consumer IoT only)                                                                                        |
| Finance              | DORA (Regulation, CTPP oversight live)            | PRA/FCA op-res + CTP regime + PS26/2 (2027)                                                                                     |
| AI                   | AI Act                                            | No AI statute; regulator-led principles                                                                                         |

Northern Ireland follows some EU product rules under the Windsor Framework — check whether the CRA reaches NI-placed products before assuming PSTI alone (verify).

## Common pitfalls

- Assuming "we're NIS2-ready" covers the UK (different regulators, scope and forms) — or the reverse.
- Treating the Bill as in force: until commencement regs, an MSP has no statutory UK reporting duty (contracts may still impose one).
- Citing CAF v3.2 or CE v3.2 in a 2026 assessment; both were superseded.
- Ransomware-payment ban/reporting for public sector and CNI was announced as policy (2025) — I did not verify legislation in force; check before advising on payment decisions (`load_skill incident-response-leadership`).

## Pairs with

`load_skill nis2-dora` (EU side), `load_skill privacy-eu`, `load_skill eu-cra`, `load_skill choosing-a-framework`, `load_skill control-mapping` (CAF↔ISO 27001↔CSF), `load_skill cloud-assurance` (what to ask a cloud/MSP supplier), `load_skill third-party-risk`.
