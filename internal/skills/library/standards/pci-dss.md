# PCI DSS v4.0

Protects **cardholder data**. Contractual (card brands), not law, but enforced hard. The whole game is **scope**: PCI applies to the **CDE** (cardholder data environment) — every system that stores, processes, or transmits **account data**, _plus_ systems connected to or that could impact the security of those.

Canonical source: PCI SSC `PCI DSS v4.0 / v4.0.1` document library — `pcisecuritystandards.org`. Web-fetch for exact requirement text and the current SAQ instructions.

## Version timeline (get this right)

- **v4.0** released Mar 2022; **v3.2.1 retired 31 Mar 2024**.
- **v4.0.1** (minor clarifying revision) published mid-2024 — use it as current.
- A large block of **future-dated requirements became mandatory 31 Mar 2025** (e.g. anti-phishing, automated log review, client-side script integrity 6.4.3 / 11.6.1, MFA refinements). After that date they are **required, not best-practice** — verify the exact list against the current standard.
- New in v4.0: the **Customized Approach** (meet the objective your own way, with a **Targeted Risk Analysis** + assessor validation) alongside the traditional **Defined Approach**.

## Account data — what's in scope

- **Cardholder Data (CHD)**: PAN, cardholder name, expiry, service code. PAN is the trigger; if PAN is stored you must protect it (render unreadable — truncation/hashing/encryption).
- **Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD)**: full track, CAV2/CVC2/CVV2/CID, PIN/PIN block. **SAD must NOT be stored after authorization** — even encrypted. This is the #1 hard rule.

## SAQ types (self-assessment questionnaires, for eligible merchants)

Validation level depends on how you handle cards. Pick wrong and you under/over-scope:

- **SAQ A** — fully outsourced e-commerce/MOTO, _no_ CHD touches your systems (e.g. fully hosted/redirect or iframe). Smallest scope. v4.0 added script/HTTP-header requirements even here.
- **SAQ A-EP** — e-commerce that _partially_ outsources but your site delivers payment-page elements (direct-post / JS that touches the payment form). Much larger than A — commonly confused with A.
- **SAQ B** — imprint machines / standalone dial-out terminals, no electronic storage.
- **SAQ B-IP** — standalone IP-connected PTS terminals, no storage.
- **SAQ C-VT** — virtual terminal, manual entry, one device, no storage.
- **SAQ C** — payment app on an internet-connected system, no storage.
- **SAQ P2PE** — validated P2PE solution, hardware terminals only.
- **SAQ D** — everyone else: merchants that store CHD or don't fit above, **and all service providers** (D-SP). Effectively the full standard.

Higher transaction volumes (Level 1) require a **QSA-led RoC** (Report on Compliance), not an SAQ — verify brand thresholds.

## The 12 requirements (6 goals)

1. Install/maintain **network security controls** (firewalls/segmentation)
2. Apply **secure configurations** (no vendor defaults)
3. **Protect stored account data**
4. **Strong cryptography in transit** over open/public networks
5. Protect systems from **malicious software**
6. **Secure systems & software** (patching, secure dev, 6.4.3 script integrity)
7. **Restrict access by need-to-know**
8. **Identify users & authenticate** (incl. MFA)
9. **Restrict physical access**
10. **Log and monitor** all access
11. **Test security regularly** (scans, pentest, 11.6.1 payment-page tamper detection)
12. **Support with policy & programs** (incl. TPSP/vendor management)

## Scoping mistakes that blow up an assessment

- **Flat network** — no segmentation means _everything_ is in the CDE. Segment (and prove it with segmentation pen-testing) to shrink scope.
- **Forgetting connected/security-impacting systems** — AD, jump hosts, monitoring, NTP, DNS, hypervisors that _touch_ the CDE are in scope even if they never see a PAN.
- **Storing SAD** — caching CVV in logs, app debug, or a payment gateway response is an automatic fail.
- **PAN in unexpected places** — logs, error dumps, email, screenshots, backups, call recordings, dev/test data.
- **Claiming SAQ A while delivering payment-page code** — that's A-EP. Redirect/iframe-to-PSP = A; your-JS-touches-the-card-field = A-EP.
- **Out-of-date third-party (TPSP) responsibilities** — you inherit their PCI status only with a documented responsibility matrix.

## Pairs with

- Network-segmentation validation testing: `load_skill network-enumeration`.
- Gap assessment / control mapping against your other frameworks: `load_skill gap-analysis`, `load_skill control-mapping`.
