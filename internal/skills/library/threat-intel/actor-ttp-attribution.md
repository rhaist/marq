# Actor & TTP attribution

Map what you saw to ATT&CK techniques and, cautiously, to a named actor. Behaviour
attributes more reliably than infrastructure — actors swap IPs/domains, but reuse
tradecraft. Lead with TTPs, treat actor naming as a hypothesis.

## 1. Search the evidence — ORKL first

- For every IOC and tool/malware name you have, search ORKL:
  `curl -s 'https://orkl.eu/api/v1/library/search?query=<ioc-or-tool-or-actor>'`.
  Returns the threat reports that mention it. Overlapping reports across several
  of your indicators = a candidate cluster. Read them for the actor's named TTPs.
- urlscan / Shodan pivots (see `ioc-pivoting`) to find infra also named in those
  reports — corroboration, not proof.

## 2. Map behaviour to ATT&CK technique IDs

- Translate each observation into a technique ID, e.g. spearphish link →
  **T1566.002**; scheduled task persistence → **T1053.005**; LSASS dump →
  **T1003.001**; WMI exec → **T1047**; web shell → **T1505.003**; living-off-the-
  land binaries → **T1218**.
- Web-fetch the current technique page `https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T####/`
  to confirm scope, sub-techniques, and which groups use it — do **not** rely on
  memorised mappings; pages change.
- Build the kill-chain row by row: tactic → technique ID → your evidence →
  source. Gaps are fine; note "not observed", don't invent.

## 3. Candidate actor — converge, don't guess

- Intersect: which group(s) appear in the ORKL reports AND use your observed
  technique set AND match victim sector/geo/timing. Convergence of independent
  axes raises confidence; a single shared tool does not.
- Beware: shared open-source tooling (Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz, Impacket), false
  flags, and copied IOCs from prior reports. Commodity malware ≠ attribution.
- **APAC source-bias pitfall:** ORKL and English-language reporting skew Western
  and under-cover APAC-targeting activity. For actors hitting JP/KR/IN/SEA, a "no
  ORKL hits" result is often a coverage gap, not a clean sheet — cross-check
  regional CERTs (JPCERT/CC, KrCERT/KISA, CERT-In, AusCERT) and regional vendors
  (AhnLab, NSFOCUS, QiAnXin), and expect heavier alias sprawl across them.

## 4. Confidence + output

- State confidence explicitly (low/medium/high) with the reasons. Default to
  **low** unless multiple independent axes converge. "Consistent with X" ≠ "is X".
- Note actor-name aliasing (vendors name the same group differently) — list the
  aliases you found rather than picking one.
- `write_file` an ATT&CK Navigator-style layer or a tactic→technique table;
  `report_finding` the TTPs (durable, defensible) with report URLs as references.
  Attribution goes in the narrative as a hypothesis, not as a finding's fact.
