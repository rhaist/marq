# Control mapping (assess once, report many)

A finding implicates the same control under every framework. Map it once so you
don't reassess per-standard, and so one fix can close N audit line items.

## Workflow

1. Take the finding: `read_file /work/findings.md` (or a single `report_finding` entry).
   Identify the control _intent_ (e.g. "user input isn't validated" -> input validation /
   secure development).
2. Anchor on the CWE the finding already carries — it's your pivot into framework controls.
3. Pull the equivalent control id in each in-scope framework. Versions change ids and
   wording: `load_skill` the standards domain and web-fetch the current text; the table
   below is a starting pointer, confirm the live id before you cite it in a deliverable.
4. Write the mapping row. One fix recommendation, tagged with every framework id it satisfies.

## Pivot table (verify ids against current versions)

| Logging & monitoring (CWE-778)               | A.8.15, A.8.16         | DE.CM        | AU-2, AU-6       | CC7.2        | 8      |
| Secure config / hardening (CWE-16)           | A.8.9                  | PR.PS-01     | CM-6, CM-7       | CC7.1        | 4      |

## Output

`write_file /work/control-map.md`:

| Finding/risk ref | CWE | Theme | ISO | NIST CSF | SOC 2 | CIS | One remediation | Status |
| ---------------- | --- | ----- | --- | -------- | ----- | --- | --------------- | ------ |

- "One remediation" is the point: a single fix line, then the list of control ids it
  closes — auditors for different standards each see their id satisfied.
- Roll up: count distinct controls touched per framework to show coverage from the
  engagement ("this pentest exercised 14 of ISO Annex A's controls").

## Rules

- Map by control _intent_, not keyword. A CWE can land in two themes — list both rows.
- Don't claim a framework id you haven't read the current text of; mark unverified rows.
- A divergent finding severity vs control criticality is signal — note it, don't smooth it.
