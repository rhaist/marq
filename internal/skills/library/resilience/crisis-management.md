# Crisis management

A crisis is when the impact exceeds what the incident team can own — it's now a
_business_ event (revenue, legal, reputation, survival), not a technical one. Your job
is governance, decisions, and communications, while the technical incident commander
runs the response (`load_skill incident-response-leadership`). Don't merge the two
roles: one drives recovery, the other drives the business through it.

## The handoff: incident → crisis

Declare a crisis (activate this layer) when any trigger hits:

- Critical activity is down past (or trending past) its MTPD/RTO (`load_skill business-continuity`).
- Confirmed/plausible regulated-data breach, or extortion/ransomware with business impact.
- Material financial, safety, or reputational exposure; or media/customer awareness.

On declaration: the incident commander keeps technical command; the **crisis team** takes
strategic decisions, external comms, and regulatory clocks. Single timeline, single source
of truth, shared with IR — don't fork the narrative.

## Crisis team & decision authority

- **Roles**: crisis lead (chairs, owns decisions), exec sponsor (budget/risk acceptance),
  Legal, Comms/PR, IR/tech liaison, HR, business-unit owners, scribe. Named deputies for
  each — crises run nights/weekends.
- **Pre-agree authority _before_ the crisis**: who can authorise system isolation, public
  statements, ransom decisions, invoking DR/failover, spending. Tabletops exist largely to
  expose that this is undefined. Undefined authority = paralysis at 3am.
- **Decision log**: every decision with time, owner, rationale, and what was known then.
  This is the record for regulators, insurers, and the post-mortem.

## Deciding under uncertainty

- Decide on **time-boxed** information, not certainty — set a decision deadline and commit;
  a good-enough decision now usually beats a perfect one after MTPD.
- Work from **reversible vs irreversible**: take reversible actions fast, slow down on
  one-way doors (paying ransom, public attribution, reimaging the only evidence).
- Frame options as scenarios (best / worst / most-likely) with explicit assumptions;
  re-decide as facts land — don't anchor on the first read.
- **Ransom is not a unilateral call**: Legal + exec + insurer, with OFAC/sanctions check
  (paying a sanctioned actor is itself illegal); decryptors often fail — recovery from
  clean backups is the real plan (`load_skill backup-recovery`).

## Communications (three audiences, one truth)

- **Internal**: facts on a cadence (e.g. hourly exec brief); tell staff what to do/not do
  (don't discuss externally, watch for follow-on phishing). Assume attacker reads corporate
  email/Slack — use out-of-band channels until proven clean.
- **External** (customers, partners, market): Legal + PR approve every word. Never promise
  "no data taken" before you know — an over-promise that reverses is the lasting wound, not
  the breach. Hold a single spokesperson.
- **Regulators**: run the clock early — GDPR Art. 33 **72h** from awareness; **NIS2 Art. 23**
  (EU essential/important entities) **24h early-warning → 72h notification → 1-month final
  report**; SEC material cyber **8-K within 4 business days**; sector rules (HIPAA, PCI, DORA
  in EU financial). **APAC clocks differ and rarely match GDPR's 72h** — e.g. Singapore PDPA
  ~3 days to the PDPC, Australia OAIC ~30 days, Japan APPI prompt-then-~30-day, often needing a
  **local-language filing** to the local regulator; a EU/US playbook that assumes GDPR covers
  everyone under-notifies. If a notifiable event is _plausible_, tell Legal now; under-notifying
  is the costly error. (Decision rules detailed in `load_skill incident-response-leadership`.)

## Tabletop exercise design

- **Objective first**: pick one decision to stress (e.g. "when do we pay / notify / fail
  over?"), not "test everything". Scenario = plausible ransomware/extortion with injects.
- **Right people in the room**: each function that holds authority must be present — the
  point is to surface who-decides-what gaps, not to teach IT to restore.
- **Inject escalation**: drip new facts (data on a leak site, media call, regulator query)
  to force re-decisions under pressure and test comms approval speed.
- **Capture & close**: after-action report with concrete gaps + owners + dates; feed into
  the BC/DR programme. Run ≥ annually (and a regulatory mandate for many: DORA, CPS230,
  FCA/PRA, MAS, FFIEC). verify: https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/services/cisa-tabletop-exercise-packages
- Escalate realism over time: tabletop → functional drill → DR full-interruption test
  (`load_skill disaster-recovery`).
